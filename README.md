# secreport - Reports for the Computer Security course of the University of Namur
`secreport` is a $\LaTeX$ class that facilitates the writing of reports for the practical classes of the Computer Security course of the [University of Namur](https://unamur.be).

## Installation
To use this class, you can either compile `secreport.ins` with your favourite $\LaTeX$ compiler, or download the latest release to get `secreport.cls`.

Once you have it, place it in the root folder of your project and import it in your main `.tex` file as you would import a normal document class, with `\documentclass[<options>]{secreport}`.

Similarly, to get a copy of the documentation, you can either compile `secreport.dtx` or get it from the latest release.

## Usage
*TODO*

Check the documentation for examples and more detailed instructions.
